The War of the Gods was a war between the forces of [[Laikodaemon]] ([[Portras]], [[Qaiyion]], and [[Democratic Theocracy of Velast|Velast]]) and [[Velikeinen]] ([[Cannosk]], [[Arstlan]], and [[Erestal Empire|Erestal]]). The war began in 1196 LL, and ended 1212 LL.

__Growing Tension Between Cults__


__Instigating Event: Fall of Antol, Rise of Erestal__
After the [[Antol Civil War]], the Erestal Empire rose to power. Under the rule of Emperor Erentas, followers of all gods other than Velikeinen were hunted down and slaughtered across the Empire, with a particular focus on eradicating the old Laikodaemon worship of the area. This move broke the tension between the two god's followers, escalating into all out war.

__Portras / Cannosk Front__
The war started off relatively quietly, with religious leaders of both gods condemning each other and promoting violence, churches being burned down in the night, and small scale battles wherever followers of both gods could be found. The followers of Laikodaemon and Velikeinen in Portras and Cannosk, respectively, had larger goals. One year after the rist of Erestal, religious extremists took over the governments of both countries, and war was officially declared.
