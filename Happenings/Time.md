The current year is 733 LL.

There are a couple of ways to mark time.

LL is the most common.
LL stands for Lelein, and marks years since the [[Lelein Church]] was founded. Despite the fact that Lelein has relatively little influcence outside of [[Democratic Theocracy of Velast|Velast]], Velast's major trade network has led to this measure of time being used in most parts of [[Golloc]], and some parts of [[Annoc]]. Years before 0 LL are marked in VL. VL refers to a phrase used in ancient Velast, roughly translating to "Era of Gods". VL counts in reverse, such that the year before 0 LL is 1 VL.

KE is an ancient measure.
The words of KE are forgotten, but the meaning lives on - Until Death. KE originated with worshippers of Oros. It is said to mark time until some horrible catastrophe, but it counts upwards. The current year is 10502 KE.

CREE and RM are newer measures.
CREE stands for Continuation of the Reign of Emperor Erenval, and marks years since Erestal was founded. It is exclusively used in Erestal, and is the only measure of time allowed in Erestal, by decree of the Emperor. CREE doesn't have an official way of marking years before 0, leading to some inconsistences in records - the most common method is to use BREE (Before the Reign of Emperor Erenval). The current year is 38 CREE.
RM stands for Rule of Monolith, and marks years since the nation of Monolith came into existence. RM is used on Monolith official documents, usually alongside the date in LL. Most of Monolith continues to use LL. Years before 0 are marked as negative numbers. The current year is 21 RM.
