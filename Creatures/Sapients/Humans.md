Humans are very basic sapients. Two legs, two arms, two eyes, one nose. A pair of small, squashed ears on the sides of their heads. a bit of hair on their scalp. The reader is probably familar with their variation in shape. Humans are omnivorous.

Humans tend to be curious creatures, greatly interested in how things work and why things happen. They tend to be at the forefront of technological advancements, but also have shorter average lifespans due to their behavior, bordering on reckless.

Their most notable physical difference from other sapients is their symmetry. Humans have rough internal symmetry, with two of most organs, mirrored horizontally. Those along the line of symmetry have no copy, but are themselves are roughly symmetrical.
