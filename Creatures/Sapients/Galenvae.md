Galenvae are sapients designed to be predators. Long, lightly furred ears on the sides of the head, designed to ventilate heat and pick up quiet noises. Thin eyes with thick eyelashes, designed to avoid sunlight during the day. Sand colored pelts. Long, almost gangly limbs, usually moved with surprising elegance. Galenvae are known for using spears for combat, extending their already impressive reach further. Galenvae are omnivorous, but prefer to meat often.

Galenvae tend to be distrustful of others, but usually try not to let it show. Many sapients have been surprised to learn their Galenvae friends didn't truly trust them after years. Due to this trait, Galenvae tend to set up very slow moving governments, ones that their enemies would be extremely hard pressed to use against them, and usually favor Galenvae politicians, trusting that they will not trust others.

Galenvae were made by [[Cardalia]] without the input of the other gods. Cardalia has no power over souls, and as such, Galenvae do not have souls. Due to this, they cannot use magic, and cannot be revived from the dead through the typical methods. Conversely, they cannot be affected by many magics. The Galenvai tend to trust Cardalia more than they do mortals.

The Galenvae tend to be nomadic, but since the end of the [[War of the Gods]], many have recognized the advantages of having a place to call home. With this in mind, many of them have gathered and settled in [[Haven]].
