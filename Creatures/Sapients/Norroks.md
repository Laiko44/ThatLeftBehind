Norroks are flightless avian sapients. Norroks are heavily feathered, with legs similar to a bird's and wings that end in talons. Norroks have 3 eyes and a beak. White is the most common color for a Norrok's feathers, but many colors are possible - Some Norroks even dye their feathers, giving an even wider range. Norroks are omnivorous.

Of the sapients, Norroks are a special case. They have a strong physical connection to the power of [[Velikeinen]]. This connection makes their physical forms very mutable - Norroks with weak connections might be able to pack their wings away more than should be possible, while those with strong connections can change their shape wildly. These Norroks might mimic non-sentient avians, grow in size, or in rare cases even mimic other sentients.

Norroks are wanderers, and can be found in small numbers anywhere they can survive. Norroks are originally from somewhere in the far north, though where exactly has been lost to time. Norroks are still the only sapient to be found in substantial numbers in the [[Deadlands]], due in part to a supernatural resistance to cold.
