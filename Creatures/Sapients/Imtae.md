Imtae are large, cold-blooded, scaled sapients. They are, on average, taller and stronger than most other sapients. Imtae each have two arms, two legs, and a tail. They have snouts, long enough to fit an impressive array of teeth, and they have horns of various shapes on the backs of their heads, on their jawlines, and occasionally down part of their spines. Imtal are carnivorous.

Imtae are known for placing honor over life. While this is an exaggerated stereotype, it has some basis in reality - Imtae do put great importance on honor, mostly when related to combat. Many an Imtal has fled their home in shame after losing a fight or failing a hunt in a particularly pathetic manner, unwilling to face their family and friends.

The Imtal homeland used to be in the center of what is now the [[Arst Disputed Zone|ADZ]]. The Imtae consider it a great shame that their homeland has been brought to ruin, and it is generally considered a bad idea to talk to them about it. Imtae have been extremely unpredictable around this topic, each handling the loss very differently. an Imtal may ignore one who comments on it, but they may also fly into a burning rage or refuse to associate with them.
