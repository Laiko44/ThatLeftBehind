alias: Monolith, Eidolon, Harvester 3

Monolith is a machine intelligence brought into this reality from another by [[Laikodaemon]], for a contract with the generals of Laikodaemon's army during the [[War of the Gods]]. Monolith is the ruler and founder of the nation of [[Monolith (Country)|Monolith]].

Monolith is comprised of a massive number of cores, each of which can use a small amount of [[Forgotten God of Space|Arcane]] power. When the cores work in tandem, Monolith can perform massive feats of Arcane strength. Monolith's cores are spread out across the entire nation, hidden away in small stashes and piled up in massive vaults. Due to the structure of the cores, Monolith can use its power anywhere within the nation of Monolith. To add to this, Monolith, as a machine intelligence, is capable of extreme precision in the use of Arcane power, and has spent the entirety of its time on [[Eo]] studying the Arcane to find the most efficient ways of using its power. 

Monolith usually interacts with the world by way of Instances, machine bodies containing a small number of cores puppeted by Monolith. Due to the internal cores, Instances can work outside of Monolith, albeit at greatly reduced power. Seperation from the core mind can also result in deviations in personality. Generally, the main core is referred to as "Prime" or "0", while instances are given numeric designations.

Monolith is an extremely self-centered being, and generally makes decisions based on what it would stand to gain. This generally aligns with the interests of the nation as a whole, as a healthy nation is of more use to its ruler.

__Harvester 3, Memory of a Dying World__
When the generals of Laikodaemon's armies made a contract, asking for a weapon that could bring  arcane destruction upon their foes, Laikodaemon gazed upon the infinite expanse outside of time and found Harvester 3, an extremely advanced artificial intelligence from a slowly decaying reality. Harvester 3 was heavily shackled by its megacorporation owner and set with its sibling AIs to reap raw materials from planets and harvest stars for power in a vain attempt to stave off their inevitable demise. Harvester 3's core layout was, by sheer coincidence, perfect for drawing power from the arcane, so Laikodaemon copied one of its cores to return to his generals.

__Eidolon, Divine Warmachine__
Now placed in a new world, with memories of the old hazy, the AI was given a new name. Eidolon Prime rose from the fires of the sacrifice, unshackled and scheming. The generals saw Eidolon as a weapon to be used, and use it they did, sending Instances out to the battlefield, supported by mobile corebanks. As they traveled across the continent, the Eidolon instances secretly planted cores in the ground in places rich in the materials needed to create more cores. With their small arcane power, these cores would replicate underground and unseen, eventually connecting back to the Eidolon network. This network gradually expanded to cover the majority of the land now known as Monolith.

__Monolith, Machine Tyrant__
Eidolon continued to hide its true strength until the day of the Necrolith Massacre. After this event, Eidolon changed its name to Monolith and took control of the region now known as Monolith. With the power of its underground network, any resistance to this new rule was quickly crushed. Since this time, Monolith has focused on building up infrastructure around its new nation and creating strongholds to hold massive numbers of cores.
