Erentas Erenval is the first emperor of the [[Erestal Empire]]. They are a [[Humans|human]], albeit one twisted by [[Velikeinen]]'s power beyond recognition.

Erentas was not born a ruler, and is not fit to be a ruler still, and they know it.
They took power in [[Antol]], the nation they would soon rename after themselves to Erestal, by trickery and violence. Trickery, in that they fooled many into using certain rituals to Velikeinen that gave great power at the cost of weakened minds, weakened minds they would soon take advantage of through their own twisted rituals. Violence, in that with this new army of Velikeinen warped soldiers, they walked through the streets, killing and maiming all who dared oppose their new ruler, wiping out the royal guard and sacrificing the royal family to Velikeinen.

This sacrifice, one that killed the order of a whole nation and ruined the hopes of her people, was extremely valuable to Velikeinen, and Velikeinen rewards his followers well. Erentas found themselves with the power to exact their will upon a nation in fear, raising armies from the dead and rotting away those who dare attack them.
