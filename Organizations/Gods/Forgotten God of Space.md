The forgotten God of Space falls on the axis of Order and Reality.
It was the designer of [[Anske]].

The forgotten god of Space is the source of the material plane, and by extension, [[Eo]]. Its dream, as it rests comatose, is the universe. The forgotten god of Space can grant power unconciously to those whose minds align with its own. This is known as 'Arcane Magic'. Arcane Magic can warp the laws of space to cause a number of effects, such as spontaneous generation of matter and energy.

The forgotten god of Space has few demigods, but they are quite powerful, using the Arcane with masterful proficiency. Each has a wildly different personality, and most think in very alien ways. These demigods are commonly referred to as Warpborn. Scholars understand little about them.
