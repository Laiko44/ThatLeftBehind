Laikodaemon falls on the axis of Order and Knowledge.
He was the designer of [[Imtae]].

Laikodaemon is the god of contracts, merchants, half-truths, deception. He is worshipped by those who seek power in organizations, those who scam others, those who wish for their contracts to last forever, and the citizens of [[Democratic Theocracy of Velast|Velast]]. His teachings are extremely complicated and full of loopholes. This is intended as a challenge to his followers - the better they understand his teachings, the less restrictive those teachings become, and the better they understand how to write contracts.

Laikodaemon gives power through a contract system. Laikodaemon's contracts tend to involve unusual prices, such as societal standing, knowledge, or skills, in exchange for whatever the recieving party desires. Some more basic contracts involve parts of the body, especially the eyes. Laikodaemon's system is extremely stable, with predictable downsides and low risk of death. The recieving party always sells their name to Laikodaemon - In most cases this is purely a formality, with no effect. In stronger contracts, Laikodaemon enforces this clause, barring the recieving party from using their name. Usually, the recieving party takes up the name "Laiko" in these cases.

Laikodaemon's demigods are wraith-like beings capable of making contracts. They are often used to officiate important ceremonies, due to both their nature and their perfect memory. Unlike Laikodaemon himself, the demigods do not care for interesting contracts, instead preferring simple deals where everyone leaves satisfied. Laikodaemon's demigods are commonly referred to as Demons.
