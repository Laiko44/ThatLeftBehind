Velikeinen falls on the axis of Chaos and Life.
He was the designer of [[Norroks]].

Velikeinen is the god of decay, rot, undead, senseless violence. He is worshipped by those who seek power regardless of the consequences, those who desperately rage against that which is stronger than them, those who fight without a cause, and the Empire of [[Erestal Empire|Erestal]]. As a god of chaos, he does not have hard and fast teachings, instead opting to urge his followers to violence against established systems.

Velikeinen gives power through a sacrifice system. Those who seek power from Velikeinen must give up some part of themselves to corruption. The worshipper then gains power, both esoteric and physical, usually related to what was sacrificed. This system has the most potential gain of power of any of the gods, but comes with the harshest downsides. Most worshippers die or lose their minds shortly after sacrificing themselves. Due to this, this system is mostly used as a last ditch effort. The ritual of sacrifice is by design very simple and easy to remember - almost all of Velikeinen's worshippers know it.

Velikeinen's demigods are violent creatures capable of creating undead. Usually, when one appears, local military or volunteers are mobilized to neutralize it. These demigods are known as Liches.
