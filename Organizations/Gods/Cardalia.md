Cardalia falls on the axis of Order and Life.
She was the designer of [[Galenvae]].

Cardalia is the god of life, flesh, vitality, blood. She is worshipped by those who work with meat, those who fight for a cause, the Galenvae (and by extension most of the [[Arst Disputed Zone|ADZ]]), and her rapidly growing church in [[Monolith (Country)|Monolith]]. Her teachings used to be relatively loose, focusing on delighting in the hunt and upholding the order of the strong over the weak, but have shifted toward showing compassion to living things and perserving the order of life.

Cardalia gives power though a champion system. Those who commit themselves to her faith can choose to have their flesh or mind warped to gain strength of the body or more esoteric powers. This process is not without downsides - Champions tend to look unnatural, and the process gives Cardalia herself a direct line into their mind. If the champion acts against her will, she can punish them or even force them to take specific actions.

Cardalia's demigods mostly exist in the material plane as large intelligent beasts in wild areas. They usually aid travellers who get lost near their realms, but loathe this responsibility put on them by Cardalia, and make this very clear to travelers. Cardalia's demigods are usually referred to as Guardians or Angels.
