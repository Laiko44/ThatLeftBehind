Pelastor Church is a religious organization devoted to [[Laikodaemon]] Based in [[Democratic Theocracy of Velast|Velast]].

Pelastor Church, though it claims to be open to all, mainly appeals to the upper class - the merchants and nobility of Velast. Pelastor Church takes great care to keep their public image as a high-class, respectable church.

Pelastor's government branch is devoted to Laikodaemon's aspect of merchants. It generally proposes legislation that would aid the merchants of Velast, loosening restrictions on trade and labor.

Pelastor's religion branch manages a relatively small number of churches, but the churches they manage are some of the largest and most magnificient in the country. Pelastor Church offers most of the standard services for a church of The Daemon, such as business contracts and marriages, but tend to require a certain level of class from those who wish to use said services. Pelastor also offers some more discreet services for wealthy clients, including contracts with Laikodaemon or less-than-legal deals.
