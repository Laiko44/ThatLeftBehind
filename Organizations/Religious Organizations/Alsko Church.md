Alsko Church is a religious organization devoted to [[Laikodaemon]] Based in [[Democratic Theocracy of Velast|Velast]].

Alsko Church is the smallest of the three churches to Laikodaemon in Velast. Their teachings, while they do align with Laikodaemon's teachings, tend toward extremist views that most worshippers of The Daemon don't like to acknowledge. Alsko church has been known to tell its followers about loopholes it has found in the laws of Velast, encourage creating dangerous contracts with Laikodaemon, spread information on how to perform legal scams, and teach how to lie-without-lying, the art of misleading others while still telling the truth.

Alsko's government branch is the weakest branch of the government of Velast. It is devoted to Laikodaemon's aspect of deception, and often proposes bizarre, overly complicated laws that would give great advantages to those who understand them completely. These laws never pass. Alsko also seems to find perverse pleasure in viciously attacking whichever faction of the government holds the most power at any time. This usually means targeting [[Lelein Church]], but the other factions have been targeted before. In one recorded instance, one of Alsko's delegates believed that Alsko had the upper hand in negotiations, and immediately started arguing against his own faction.
