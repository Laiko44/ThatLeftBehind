Alask is the capital of [[Helsk]].

Alask, despite being a capital, is a relatively small city, mostly consisting of government workers and officials' homes and workplaces. The government of Helsk is run here, but little else.

Food and supplies are mostly shipped in from outside, but due to a law in place that no businesses are allowed to operate in the capital, all sales must happen outside the city. This has led to a small but thriving commerical district right outside of the city limits. Most sales in this district are orders for goods to be shipped to a specific location, such as food to a house or paper and writing supplies to a secretary's office.
