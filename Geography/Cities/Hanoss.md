Hanoss is one of the member cities of the [[Havaly Union]].

Hanoss is the central city of the Havaly Union, and the location where all meetings pertaining to the Union take place. Hanoss prides itself on being impartial in any of the conflicts between other member cities, and as such is officially atheist and has no official ties with other nations or organizations except those created by the union as a whole.

Hanoss is also a center for trade in the [[Aras Sea]], having a substantial fleet of boats carrying shipments to and from everywhere in the sea and its rivers. Anywhere the Aras Sea connects, their boats can be found. Notably, the [[Panarac Trade Corporation]] is also headquartered here.
