Neuharst is a citystate located in the [[Arst Disputed Zone|ADZ]].

Neuharst is a very new citystate. Neuharst's main goal is to reunify the entirety of the ADZ under its banner. To this end, it is currently waging war with [[Harrown]].

Neuharst is a authoritarian state, run by a council. The unrest caused by the war with Harrown has caused great instability in the council, and the current council head, Canton Lenv, is expected to make a grab for power soon.

Neuharst is also currently has an active military draft, and is conscripting many of its citizens into the army to fight its floundering war.
