Citadel is the capital city of [[Monolith (Country)|Monolith]].

Citadel is Monolith's capital, located to the far north. Citadel is a massive structure of alloyed metals surrounded by rather high class residential and commerce sectors. The Citadel itself houses a large part of [[Monolith (Individual)|Monolith]]'s core, as well as a massive amount of laboratory and R&D space, where Monolith and its most trusted researchers attempt to create the technologies Monolith remembers from before its summoning. Security on the Citadel is extremely tight and mostly lethal.
