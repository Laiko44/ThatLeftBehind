Laiko is a city located in [[Democratic Theocracy of Velast|Velast]].

Laiko is a city of great mystery. Around a century ago, a contract with [[Laikodaemon]] was made by the mayor of the city. As a result of this contract, all records of the city from before that time were erased, the city lost its name, and the mayor in question ceased to exist. The true extent of what this contract did is unknown.

What is known is that Laiko can move, and does so almost constantly, churning through the ground as if it was a boat in water. The city mainly moves through the uninhabited sections of Velast's deserts and grasslands, tending to avoid the swamps to the south. Many merchants and traders work out of Laiko - constant movement makes picking up interesting trade goods and running into new people easier. Laiko often moves near [[Vol Hoi]] and [[Calhos]], making trade with those cities consistently inconsistent.
