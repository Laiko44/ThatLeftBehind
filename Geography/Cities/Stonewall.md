Stonewall is a city located in [[Helsk]].

Stonewall is Helsk's largest city, and a major trade center on the [[Aras Sea]]. Stonewall also has the lowest percentage of [[Anske|Ansk]] residents of any Helsk city, and as such has far better accommodations for non-Ansk residents.

In the distant past, Helsk was more isolationist than it is now. Stonewall was founded in that time, with the intent for it to be a first line of defense against any invasions from the north. Alongside the construction of Stonewall, a physical stone wall was intended to be built covering most of the northern coast. This plan fell through, but not before a sizable portion of wall was built. In this age, the wall is not maintained, but remnants still remain, reminders of the city's original purpose.
