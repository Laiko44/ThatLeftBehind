Glaseie is a city located in [[Monolith (Country)|Monolith]].

Glaseie is a pre-Monolith city. Situated between two parts of [[The Arnoth Range]], Glaseie has good agricultural exports and a couple of large mines. Glaseie never grew very large due to its somewhat hard to reach position. Recently, Monolith created a diplomatic hall on the mountainside near Glaseie, giving it a substantial economic boost. Monolith plans to invite diplomats from many nations and organizations to the hall soon.
