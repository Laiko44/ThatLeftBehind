Nauuis is a very old kingdom and the ancestral homeland of the Nauu. Nauuis is known for its beautiful architecture and large forests.

Nauuis' monarchs, when seen in public in any official capacity, always wear the Auric Design, an artifact created by Oros. The Auric Design is an exoskeleton that molds itself to the wearer's body. It has looked slightly different for each of the monarchs who have worn it, but generally the wearer's height is increased to 9 feet tall and large antlers are placed atop their head. The Auric Design protects the monarch from harm and gives them some measure of anonymity. The suit itself is quite durable, and the wearer's appearance changes drastically when they wear it.
