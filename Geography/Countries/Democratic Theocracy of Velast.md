Current Ruler: High Prophet Laiko
Official Religion: [[Lelein Church]]
Capital: [[Melos]]

Velast is a country with a strange lack of recorded history - most of what is known about Velast's distant past is thanks to the records of their neighbors. What is known is that the worship of Laikodaemon has existed in some form in the area for longer than recorded history, and a great many contracts with Laikodaemon have warped the area to an insane degree. Indeed, the lack of history is usually blamed on some long forgotten contract. With bizarre swamps, vast deserts, large numbers of strange monstrous creatures and powerful artifacts and ruins buried in the sand, Velast is a dangerous place to live and a fascinating place to explore.

Velast's governmental system is fittingly bizarre. The High Council consists of 24 delegates. The three churches of Laikodaemon based in Velast, [[Lelein Church]], [[Alsko Church]], and [[Pelastor Church]], each send 6 delegates, and 6 more are democratically elected from different regions of Velast to serve as representatives of the people. Lelein Church, being the dominant church in Velast, gives one of their delegates the position of High Prophet. The High Prophet serves as the head of the High Council.
This system balances between the different factions of Velast, with Lelein Church acting on behalf of the government itself, Pelastor Church acting in the interest of corporations, the representatives coming to the aid of the people, and Alsko Church keeping any of the others from getting too greedy.

Velast's geography is, as mentioned previously, unusual and unnatural. The northwest half of Velast is very dry, alternating between deserts, canyons, and barren dirt. Heading southwest, one finds seemingly random patches of forest and grassland start to appear in the desert more and more frequently, eventually giving way to a lush and hospitable belt. This then breaks down into swampland. To the west of Velast, an island of solid stone exists - a single, perfect pillar emerging from the sea, with the capital of Melos built into it.
