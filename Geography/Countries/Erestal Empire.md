The Empire of Erestal is a relatively new government placed over a very old nation. The Empire is currently being ruled by their majesty Emperor [[Erentas Erenval]] the First, a mysterious being and worshipper of Velikeinen, who took the throne in the brutal [[Antol Civil War]]. Erentas's actions during this civil war, and especially their inhumane treatment of the worshippers of other gods, greatly increased the hostility between the two sides of the [[War of the Gods]], almost directly leading to the already delicate situation boiling over.

The Empire is a relatively isolationist nation. It has had great difficulty getting allies or even good relations with other nations, mostly due to its Emperor's extremely enigmatic and violent behavior.
Erentas knows this is an issue, and has created a church, The Silent Council, to, ironically, speak for the Empire in matters of foreign relations. Only time will tell if this is an effective strategy.

The Empire's geography is relatively uniform. Erestal is mostly covered in forests, with the occasional open plain. Small rivers and creeks are not uncommon, flowing down from the mountains into the [[Iron Lake]], then from there to the coast or toward the [[Aras Sea]].
