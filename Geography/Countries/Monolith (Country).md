Monolith is a relatively new country on the world stage, having just come into existence after the [[War of the Gods]]. Monolith, the ruler of the nation, is a machine intelligence brought to this world by [[Laikodaemon]] to assist his army. Monolith had no interest in cooperating with the Church of Laikodaemon, and instead built up its power to annihilate both armies in one fell swoop, in what is now referred to as the Eidolon Massacre. Monolith then proceeded to create the nation of Monolith, a totalitarian regime where Monolith's word is law. More recently, Monolith has formed an agreement with the Church of Our Lady in Red, Where Monolith lets the Church spread its ideals, while the Church provides aid to the poor and sick.

Monolith is a technologically advanced nation, owing greatly to the otherworldly knowledge Monolith brought with it when summoned to this world. These techological secrets are both Monolith's greatest strength and weakness. Strength in powerful and efficient tools and weapons, but weakness in Monolith's paranoia at any of this information leaking to other nations. Monolith currently has very tight borders.

Monolith's geography varies substantially. In the far north, the edge of Monolith's territory reaches the [[Deadlands]], and is eternally frozen. Heading south, we find a large, heavily forested tundra interspersed with large lakes and rivers. To the west, the [[The Arnoth Range|Arnoth mountain range]] starts here, continuing down to Monolith's south border. Heading south again, we find a grassy expanse, interspersed with forests. South futher, we find Monolith's one major beach. To the east, we find rocky cliffs overlooking the ocean.
Monolith's two neighbors are the [[Arst Disputed Zone|ADZ]] to the west and [[Nauuis Kingdom]] to the southwest.
