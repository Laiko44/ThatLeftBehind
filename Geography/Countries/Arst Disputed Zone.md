The Arst Disputed Zone is the broken aftermath of the [[War of the Gods]]. What was once the nations of [[Arstlan]] and [[Cannosk]] is now a wasteland with no central rule. In the south, a number of citystates attempt to bring back order to the land, while in the north, small settlements, nomads, hermits, and criminals attempt to survive off of the land.
