Helsk is the ancestral homeland of the Anske, and as such, its major cities are underground, with small aboveground sectors to accomodate visitors and trade. The nation as a whole is built around the fittingly named Helsk Mountain Range, a sprawling mess of mountains rising high into the sky, with Helsk Mountain and the capital of Alask at its center.

Due to its state as a nation effectively made of mines, Helsk exports a massive amount of metal, stone, and various minerals. Helsk also tries to export their excess food on occasion, but it has never found a market.
