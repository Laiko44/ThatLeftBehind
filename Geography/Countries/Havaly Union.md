Current Ruler: No central ruler
Official Religion: Varies wildly between citystates
Capital: [[Hanoss]]

Havaly Union is a collection of citystates, unified under a single banner. The citystates each maintain their own independence, laws, and rule. The union provides security, a unified front for international affairs, and ease of trade between citystates.

The government of the Havaly Union is very hands-off, but has also made trade extremely easy, so a capitalistic ideology has taken hold in the region. The extent of this ideology varies from citystate to citystate, but it is present in all of them, and unlikely to go away any time soon.
